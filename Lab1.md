# Lab Report 1

1. (b) using the cd command with no arguments.
    The working directory was /home/lecture1 when the command was run. I don't get any output because the cd command successfully runs, it changes the working directory from
   /home to /home/lecture1. The output is not an error. 
```
[user@sahara ~]$ pwd
/home
[user@sahara ~]$ cd lecture1
[user@sahara ~/lecture1]$ pwd
/home/lecture1
```
