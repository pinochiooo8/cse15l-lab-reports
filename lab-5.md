## Part 1 – Debugging Scenario
  Anonymous: Hi, I have a coding question about my java project. The compiler error output indicates that there are issues with the ChatHandler class definition and its use within the Server.start method. The probable cause for this error could be that the URLHandler interface (or class) is not defined within the scope of the compilation, is not in the correct package, or the compiler is not able to locate its definition due to classpath issues. 

  Staff : Have you checked if the URLHandler interface is in the classpath during compilation? If not, try compiling with the classpath option and specify the location of the classes or interfaces your program depends on.

  

## Part 2  -Reflection 
  In my CSE-15L class, I learned Vim, a terminal-based editor, unlocking a suite of commands that made editing fast and mouse-free. The course shows the terminal’s power, showing how it could deftly handle diverse tasks. Learning to use the ssh command to log into servers directly from my terminal was particularly eye-opening, streamlining my workflow and introducing me to remote computing. This hands-on experience in terminal operations not only sharpened my technical skills but also heightened my appreciation for the elegance and efficiency of command-line tools.
